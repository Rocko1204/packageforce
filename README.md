  - Detects @isTest annotations
  - Filters test files by naming patterns
- Advanced matching options:
  - Exact match for identical code
  - Ignore variable names for similar logic
  - Ignore literals for pattern matching

### Test Execution (SF CLI Independent)
- Run all test classes in a package without requiring SF CLI
- Direct Salesforce API integration for test execution
- Two execution modes:
  - **Asynchronous (Default)**: Queue tests and poll for results
  - **Synchronous**: Wait for immediate results
- Uses MetadataResolver to automatically find test classes
- Detects test classes by @isTest annotation  
- Shows detailed test results with:
  - Pass/fail status for each test method
  - Code coverage percentage per class with line details
  - Overall package coverage with 75% threshold indicator
  - Full stack traces for failed tests
  - Progress updates during async execution
- Beautiful output formatting in dedicated output channel

### Changelog Management
- Update package changelogs from staged Git files
- Automatically detects which packages have changes
- Interactive prompts for:
  - Change type (Feature/Fix)
  - Work item reference (e.g., JIRA ticket)
  - Change description
  - Breaking changes detection
- Updates:
  - Package versions in `sfdx-project.json`
  - README files with changelog tables
  - Stages all updated files for commit

## Commands

All commands are available in the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`):

- `Packageforce: Test Extension` - Verify the extension is working
- `Packageforce: Find Package` - Search and navigate to packages
- `Packageforce: Update Changelog` - Update changelogs from staged files
- `Packageforce: Scan Staged Files` - Run PMD analysis on all staged files

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.95.0 or higher
- Salesforce DX project with `sfdx-project.json`
- Git repository for changelog features
- Authenticated Salesforce org (no SF CLI required)

## Getting Started

1. Open a Salesforce DX project in VS Code
2. The extension activates automatically
3. Open `sfdx-project.json` to see CodeLens actions
4. Look for "SFDX Packages" in the Explorer sidebar
5. Stage some changes and run the changelog command from the toolbar

### Using Custom PMD Rules

1. Copy the `.pmd/` folder to your Salesforce project root
2. Run scan on a package from CodeLens or Package Explorer
3. Select "Scan with Custom Rules" option
4. Review violations in the Problems panel

Example custom rules included:
- **Missing Data Factory**: Detects direct record instantiation in tests (CRITICAL)
- **Empty Object Description**: Flags objects without descriptions (HIGH)
- **Empty Field Description**: Flags fields without descriptions or help text (HIGH)
- **Test Data Factory Pattern**: Validates factory method implementations
- **Performance Rules**: Operations with limits in loops (PMD 7.x)
- **Security Rules**: CRUD and sharing violations

### Duplicate Code Detection
- Uses PMD's Copy-Paste Detector (CPD) to find duplicate code
- Compares package code against entire repository
- Multiple sensitivity levels:
  - Quick Check: 100+ tokens (larger duplicates)
  - Standard Check: 75+ tokens
  - Deep Check: 50+ tokens (smaller duplicates)
  - Custom: Configure your own threshold
- Matching options:
  - Exact match
  - Ignore variable names
  - Ignore literals (strings/numbers)
  - Ignore both (most flexible)
- Results shown in:
  - VS Code Problems panel with navigation
  - Detailed output channel
  - Exportable reports (HTML, CSV, JSON, Markdown)

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find the Packageforce Packages view?
- Look in the Explorer sidebar (where file tree is shown)
- The view should appear under a section called "Packageforce Packages"
- Try refreshing VS Code or reloading the window

### Changelog command stops after first prompt?
- Make sure you have staged files in Git
- Check the VS Code output panel for errors
- Try the "Simple Changelog Test" command first - if this works but the full command doesn't, it's a known issue with complex quick picks
- The extension now uses simplified string-based quick picks to avoid this issue

## Extension Settings

### Packageforce Settings

Configure Packageforce in VS Code settings:

```json
{
  // Path to PMD installation (optional - will auto-download if not set)
  "forceOps.pmd.path": "/path/to/pmd",
  
  // Custom PMD rules directory (defaults to .pmd/)
  "forceOps.pmd.customRulesPath": ".pmd/",
  
  // Java executable path
  "forceOps.pmd.javaPath": "java",
  
  // Show scan results in Problems panel
  "forceOps.scan.showDiagnostics": true,
  
  // Minimum priority for violations (1-5)
  "forceOps.scan.minimumPriority": 3
}
```

### SFDX Project Settings

This extension uses settings from your `sfdx-project.json` file:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "eon-sfdx": {
      "enableReadmeGeneration": true,
      "workItemFilter": "JIRA-\\d+",
      "workItemUrl": "https://jira.example.com/browse/"
    }
  }
}
```
